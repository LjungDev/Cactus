# Project: Cactus

Set in a futuristic universe, you are a vagrant archeologist trying to find out more about your lost race.
On your travels throughout the galaxy you find a seemingly unknown planet with unusual readings. As you
descend onto the planet and explore the surface you discover an interesting ruin which may hold the answers
you seek.

Project Cactus is a linear first-person shooter game. It features weapons, monsters, bosses, and puzzles. It
is heavily inspired by old-school shooters like Unreal, Quake, and Doom, mixed with the aesthetic of sci-fi
and norse mythology.

This project is made using [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US).
